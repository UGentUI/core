# UGentUI Web Components

Welcome to the UGentUI Web Components Storybook. This documentation will guide you through the installation, usage, and theming of the UGentUI web components.

## Getting Started

To begin using UGentUI web components, install the core package by running:

```
npm install @ugent-ui/core
```

## Usage

After installation, you can start using the components by importing them into your project. For example, to use the button component:

```
import "@ugent-ui/core/components/button";
```

## Theming

To apply the default styles globally across your project, import the UGentUI style sheet:

```
import "@ugent-ui/core/style.css";
```

## Setting the Base Path

Some UGentUI components rely on external assets. To ensure the components can locate these assets, you need to set the base path:

```
import { setBasePath } from "@ugent-ui/core";
setBasePath("/node_modules/@ugent-ui/core/dist/");
```
